# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project is my own personal portfolio that I built from scratch. My motivation behind building this project was that it was my first project that I was asked to build by myself from scratch so I took the challenge head on and put my all into it. The portfolio includes hyperlinks, descriptions, specific CSS modeling and a lot more.
